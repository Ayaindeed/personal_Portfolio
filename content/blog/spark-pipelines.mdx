## Building Data Pipelines with Python and Spark

Apache Spark provides a distributed computing framework for large-scale data processing.

### Why Spark?

Performance: In-memory computation gives you significant speed advantages.
Scalability: Process terabytes of data across distributed clusters.
Flexibility: Works with SQL, Python, Scala, and R programming languages.

### Getting Started

To create a basic Spark session and read a CSV file:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("DataPipeline").getOrCreate()
df = spark.read.csv("data.csv", header=True)
df.show()
```

### Key Concepts

DataFrames are the fundamental data structure in Spark. They provide a distributed collection of data organized into named columns. RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) are the low-level API that underlies DataFrames.

### Best Practices

Cache data that will be reused multiple times in your operations.
Partition data appropriately for your specific operations.
Use higher-level APIs like DataFrames and SQL when possible.
Monitor and optimize your job performance metrics.
Consider memory requirements and cluster size carefully.
