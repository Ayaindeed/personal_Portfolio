## Getting Started with Apache Airflow

Apache Airflow is one of the most powerful tools for orchestrating complex data workflows. Whether you're managing ETL pipelines or scheduled tasks, Airflow provides a robust framework to define, schedule, and monitor your workflows.

### What is Airflow?

Airflow is a workflow orchestration platform that allows you to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. Instead of writing cron jobs or shell scripts, you define your workflows as Python code using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

### Key Concepts

DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs): DAGs represent your entire workflow. They consist of tasks and dependencies. Each task is a unit of work, and dependencies define the order in which tasks execute.

Operators: Operators define what actually happens in your tasks:
- BashOperator: Execute bash commands
- PythonOperator: Execute Python functions
- PostgresOperator: Execute SQL queries
- Many more specialized operators available

Tasks: Tasks are instances of operators. They represent a single unit of work in your DAG.

### Basic Setup

Install Airflow:

```bash
pip install apache-airflow
```

Initialize the database:

```bash
airflow db init
```

Create your first DAG:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def hello_world():
    print("Hello from Airflow!")

dag = DAG('hello_world', start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1))
task = PythonOperator(task_id='hello', python_callable=hello_world, dag=dag)
```

### Best Practices

Keep tasks idempotent and stateless to ensure reliability.
Use meaningful task and DAG names for clarity.
Set appropriate catchup and max_active_runs parameters.
Monitor your DAGs regularly for performance.
Use connections and variables for sensitive data.

### Monitoring and Maintenance

Airflow provides a web UI where you can:
- View DAG status and task execution history
- Manually trigger DAGs as needed
- View logs for debugging issues
- Monitor performance metrics
